The Underwater Classification project focuses on the classification of marine and anthropogenic sounds using advanced machine learning techniques. Its primary goal is to identify and categorize sounds, contributing to the understanding and monitoring of underwater environments.

Project Overview
Feature Analysis
The project began with a comprehensive analysis to identify the most suitable numerical features for representing audio files. This step was critical to optimize the effectiveness of the machine learning models.

Preprocessing and Normalization
A robust preprocessing pipeline was implemented, including data normalization, to ensure the quality, consistency, and reliability of the dataset.

Model Training and Evaluation
Several machine learning models were developed and rigorously evaluated to classify anthropogenic sounds into their respective categories accurately.

Optimization and Experimentation
Extensive experiments were conducted to enhance model performance, exploring different configurations, feature sets, and optimization techniques to achieve state-of-the-art results.

Academic Context
This project was developed as part of the course "Fundamentals of Computer Vision and Biometrics", within the Master's degree program in Computer Science at the University of Salerno.

Objectives
Improve understanding of underwater soundscapes by leveraging machine learning.
Develop scalable techniques for sound classification.
Contribute to environmental monitoring through accurate sound identification.
