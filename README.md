Underwater Classification
Underwater Classification is a project aimed at the classification of marine and anthropogenic sounds using advanced machine learning techniques. The project began with a preliminary analysis to identify the most suitable numerical features for representing audio files, in order to optimize the effectiveness of the subsequent machine learning models.

Following this analysis, a thorough phase of preprocessing and data normalization was carried out, ensuring the quality and consistency of the dataset. Once the dataset was prepared, several models were trained and evaluated to accurately identify and classify anthropogenic sounds into their respective categories.

Additionally, numerous experiments were conducted to refine and enhance model performance, exploring different configurations and optimization techniques to achieve the best possible results.

This project was developed as part of the course "Fundamentals of Computer Vision and Biometrics", within the Master's degree program in Computer Science at the University of Salerno.
